# 0003 — What they strip, what Vaultix rebuilds

**Status:** living ledger (2026-08-17)  
**Rule:** we do **not** copy Infisical `ee/`. We refill the gaps with Shippin-owned modules behind `shippin.vaultix.panel.v1`.

Infisical’s public repo is MIT **except** `ee/`. Cloud/Pro/Enterprise gates more than `ee/` (limits, branding, some UI). Self-host MIT core is still a real secrets product: projects, envs, CLI, inject, basic RBAC, integrations. The holes below are what a Lovable-type user will hit if we only re-skin their image.

## Gap ledger

| Gap they keep / charge for | Why a vibe coder needs it | Vaultix refill (ours) | Phase |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| White-label / product name | Must say Vaultix, never Infisical | Branding overlay + panel chrome + SMTP from-name | now |
| SAML / SSO enforcement | One login with the rest of Shippin | Authentik OIDC (estate already has it) | next |
| SCIM / LDAP | Seat join/leave without a human | Tessera + Authentik groups → Vaultix project membership | later |
| Approval workflows / access requests | “Can I use the prod OpenAI key?” | Shippin panel approval on `vaultix.secret.inject` | later |
| Secret rotation as a product | Keys die; apps must not | Inject handle + rotate lesson + our rotator, not their `ee` rotator | next |
| Dynamic secrets (DB creds that expire) | Real workspaces, not pasted URLs | Our short-lived inject tickets | later |
| Point-in-time recovery | They deleted the wrong key | `pg_dump` + encryption-key escrow + tested restore | now |
| Audit export / SIEM stream | Teach “who saw this key” | Our audit log on the panel contract | next |
| Custom roles | Tenant admin vs builder vs CI | Shippin roles via Tessera scopes | later |
| IP allowlists / gateways | Phone mesh + workspace only | Zuul + Caddy, not their gateway product | next |
| HSM / KMIP | Not a Lovable lesson | Out of scope until an estate asks | parked |
| Cloud identity caps (5 seats / 3 projects) | Their SaaS meter | Self-host MIT: no such meter. Do not re-introduce it | now (do not copy) |
| PAM / cert manager as extra SKUs | Upsell | Not Vaultix. Certs stay step-ca / Caddy | parked |

## What we refuse

- Shipping `ee/` and calling it free Vaultix  
- Re-implementing SAML when Authentik already is the IdP  
- Putting secret **values** in the Shippin catalog GET  
- Teaching paste-into-Lovable as a workaround for a missing feature  

## First refill (this standup)

1. Run MIT core ourselves (keys, TLS, backup).  
2. Name it Vaultix on the wire (`SITE_URL`, mail from, panel contract).  
3. Daily `pg_dump` + key-file escrow instructions.  
4. Signup lock after first operator (`/admin/signup` then close it).  
5. Keep a checkout of upstream so branding patches land in *our* tree, not theirs.

## Dormant capability valves (built pre-release, closed by default)

The gaps above that are panel request-flow / config toggles are now built as
**closed valves** (`panel/internal/valves`, `internal/usage`) — the plumbing
exists so enabling any of them later is a config flag, never a data-shape or
request-flow retrofit. Every valve defaults OFF; the private-cloud stance
(no meters, no gates) holds unless an operator opts in.

| Valve | Gap it covers | Env to open | Default |
|-------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Plan meter | seat/project caps (anti-goal — option only) | `VAULTIX_METER_ENFORCE=true` | unlimited, unenforced |
| Approval gate | approval workflows / access requests | `VAULTIX_APPROVAL_GATE=true` | apply immediately |
| Access policy | per-path secret gating | `VAULTIX_ACCESS_POLICY_DENY=/prod,…` | allow all |
| Rate cap | per-user rate limiting | `VAULTIX_RATE_CAP_PER_MIN=N` | no cap |
| IP allowlist | IP allowlists / gateways | `VAULTIX_IP_ALLOWLIST=cidr,…` | all sources |
| Audit stream | audit export / SIEM stream | `VAULTIX_AUDIT_STREAM_URL=…` | local log only |

Discoverable at `GET /api/v1/vaultix/capabilities` (valve states) and
`GET /api/v1/vaultix/usage` (meter view). All tested: closed = no-op,
open = enforces.

## Upstream `ee/` we will not copy

Checked out on the host at `/opt/vaultix/upstream/infisical` (`v0.162.19`). LICENSE still carves out any `ee/` tree. Actual modules under `backend/src/ee/services/` (and a smaller Go set under `backend-go/internal/ee/`):

SAML, SCIM, LDAP, OIDC add-on, license, access-approval, secret-approval, secret-rotation-v2, dynamic-secret, audit-log-stream, pit (point-in-time), gateway/gateway-v2, hsm, kmip, pam-*, pki-*, trusted-ip, rate-limit, honey-token, insights, sub-org.

Those are the product holes. Vaultix refills them with Authentik + Tessera + our panel + Zuul + our backup — not by vendoring that folder.
